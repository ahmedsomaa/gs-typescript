# Introduction

## What is TypeScript ?

> TypeScript is a JavaScript superset.

This means that TypeScript is a programming language buliding up on JavaScript by adding new features and advantages to JavaScript like types...etc. Though, it's a JavaScript superset, neither the browser nor node can execute it and it has to be compiled down to JavaScript. So the question, why TypeScript then ?

## Why TypeScript ?

- It adds new features and advantages to TypeScript like static type checking...etc.
- It helps minimizing errors as you catch errors earlier in compiletime while JavaScript catches errors in runtime.
- It makes writing OOP much better by adding iterfaces, generics...etc.
