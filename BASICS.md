# TypeScript Basics

## Core Types

- **number**

  represents all types of numbers including integers and decimals for example: 1, 2.5, -10...etc.

- **string**

  represents single or multiple charachters and can be created using either single or double quotes or backticks (Template Literals) for example: 'TS', "TS", \`TS\`

- **boolean**

  true or false just these two values, no "truthy" or "falsey" values.

## Side Notes

> JavaScript uses _dynamic types_ (resolved at runtime) while TypeScript uses _static types_ (set during development).
